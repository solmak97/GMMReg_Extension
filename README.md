# GMMReg_Extension
This repository is on reformulating point set registration using Gaussian Mixture Models while considering attributes associated with each point. Our approach introduces class score vectors as additional
features to the spatial data information. By incorporating these attributes, we enhance the optimization process by penalizing incorrect matching terms. Experimental results show that our approach with class scores
outperforms the original algorithm by [Jian and Vemuri, 2011] in both accuracy and speed.
